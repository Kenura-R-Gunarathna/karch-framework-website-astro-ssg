Composer is the recommended way to install KARCH. It automatically handles dependencies and sets up the project structure for you.

<Steps>

1.  Open your terminal.

2.  Run the create-project command:

    ```bash
    composer create-project krag/karch example-app
    ```

    Replace `example-app` with your desired project name.

3.  Navigate to your project directory:

    ```bash
    cd example-app
    ```

</Steps>

  <TabItem label="Git" icon="seti:git">

If you prefer to manage the project manually or want to contribute to the framework, you can clone the repository.

<Steps>

1.  Open your terminal.

2.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kenura-R-Gunarathna/KARCH-Framework.git
    ```

3.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd KARCH-Framework
    ```

4.  Install dependencies (if you have Composer installed):

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

</Steps>
